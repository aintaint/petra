For cocaine trafficking, "El Mayo" Ismael Zambada plead guilty, it was the lesser charge because he had been indicted for murder in New York and would not face the death penalty for ordering those hits in the United States.

In his plea he discusses mostly his involvement in cocaine trafficking. Realize that the state of Sinaloa is a west coast state, and that most of the cocaine that reaches New York passes through Texas at Juarez. So how does he become culpable for a hit under the jurisdiction of a court in New York? That's an American mafia domain. As if the Irish people are all over El Paso, or mules are running from Texas into California and Canada. This never discusses the routes in Mexico that El Mayo has charge over. It would seem to be no routes in Mexico.

Everyone noticed when Page made the top ten richest list. In hindsight, this is the paper, notice that he went off to study at Chelsea Clinton's university and all of the attention to Bill Clinton's feelings and the utility in the engine. I was in Kyiv just after Hillary Clinton left the state department. I saw the new state department complex, and the Google complex. It was the largest embassy in the region if not the world. Really huge. Google's operations in Ukraine were built, to address the larger market, to deliver Russian language services to the Russian Federation.
